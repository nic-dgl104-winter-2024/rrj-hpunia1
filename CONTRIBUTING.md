Issue 1 Project : Bulb 0n/off switch Issue : Create a simple bulb on-off button in JS #969 This issue is create a switch where Bulb should light up on toggle on and dark on toggle off. As a beginner, i was looking for a project that i can work on easily and I found this to learn and practice my Javascript skills.

# Forked version
/Hpunia1/javascript-mini-projects

# Contribution
Examine the readme.md file and crate a bulb with a toggle button to turn on/off.
* As there was code provide already so i did changes in the html, css and js files.
* Also changed the images of the bulb and the toggle switch
* Added a modal pop up when turn the switch on. So for this I search on different website like w3school.


# Reflection

The issue was easy but it's a good way to practice javascript and html. I did make changes which were not that big but still help to understand more about Javascript.

More Important, I enjoyed while working on the project. I got to know about how we work in open field as i don't have that much experience in such kind of open field project also working on github like this. After working on this i got to know how i have to grind my skill, if i want to continue my future in this field.

It's really motivating working like this. I faced some trouble in time management as we had other projects to do in the same time period. But nevertheless, got a great oppurtunity to work on such project and make our github portfolio more strong to show our projrct in futur to the open world jobs.
