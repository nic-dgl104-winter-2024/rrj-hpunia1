 ## Activity 1: Research a new Language

 ##The Power of Processing: A Visual Arts Coding Language
 Introduction to Processing

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. It's an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic art projects. Processing is a powerful tool for creating visual art and animations. For example, the artist Marius Watz uses Processing to create intricate generative art pieces that explore the intersection of code and visual design. Additionally, Processing is widely used in educational settings to introduce students to coding concepts through visual art. The simplicity and visual feedback loop of Processing make it an excellent tool for teaching computational thinking. Prototyping is another key use of Processing, with designers and artists using it to develop visual designs and interactive installations. For instance, the interactive art installation 'The Pool' by Jen Lewin Studio was prototyped using Processing before being realized in a physical space.

Users of Processing

Processing is utilized by a diverse range of individuals and communities. Artists and designers are among the primary users of Processing, leveraging its capabilities to create interactive art installations, digital illustrations, and animations. For example, the artist and designer Joshua Davis has extensively used Processing to create dynamic digital illustrations that blend art and technology. Educators also play a crucial role in the Processing community, with teachers and professors using the language as a teaching tool to introduce students to programming concepts. Students across various educational levels, from high school to university, engage with Processing as an entry point into programming, digital art, and data visualization. Furthermore, researchers working in fields such as data visualization, human-computer interaction, and computational art rely on Processing for prototyping and exploring new concepts. For instance, the research project 'Seeing Data' by Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi utilized Processing to visualize complex data sets in an artistic and engaging manner.

Useful Resources for Processing

Several valuable resources exist for individuals interested in learning and utilizing Processing. The official Processing website, processing.org, is the primary source for downloading the Processing IDE, accessing reference materials, tutorials, and examples. 'Getting Started with Processing' by Casey Reas and Ben Fry is an essential book for beginners, providing a comprehensive introduction to the language and its capabilities. OpenProcessing, a community-driven platform, serves as a hub for sharing Processing sketches, exploring works by others, and learning through examples. The Coding Train on YouTube, managed by Daniel Shiffman, offers a wealth of video tutorials on Processing, covering basic to advanced topics in an engaging manner.

Why are these specific resources useful?

* The Processing website is the most authoritative source of information about Processing, providing everything from basic setup to advanced functionalities.
* "Getting Started with Processing" breaks down the basics in a very reader-friendly manner, making it ideal for beginners.
* OpenProcessing serves as both inspiration and education, showcasing the possibilities with Processing and allowing users to learn from real projects.
* The Coding Train makes learning to code in Processing (and other languages) fun and accessible, with Daniel Shiffman's enthusiasm and clear explanations making complex concepts understandable.
* Processing Foundation Forums offer a supportive community for problem-solving, advice, and showcasing projects, which is invaluable for learners at all levels.
