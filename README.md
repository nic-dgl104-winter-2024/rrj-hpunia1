 ## Activity 1: Research a new Language

 ##The Power of Processing: A Visual Arts Coding Language
 Introduction to Processing

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. It's an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic art projects. Processing is a powerful tool for creating visual art and animations. For example, the artist Marius Watz uses Processing to create intricate generative art pieces that explore the intersection of code and visual design. Additionally, Processing is widely used in educational settings to introduce students to coding concepts through visual art. The simplicity and visual feedback loop of Processing make it an excellent tool for teaching computational thinking. Prototyping is another key use of Processing, with designers and artists using it to develop visual designs and interactive installations. For instance, the interactive art installation 'The Pool' by Jen Lewin Studio was prototyped using Processing before being realized in a physical space.

Users of Processing

Processing is utilized by a diverse range of individuals and communities. Artists and designers are among the primary users of Processing, leveraging its capabilities to create interactive art installations, digital illustrations, and animations. For example, the artist and designer Joshua Davis has extensively used Processing to create dynamic digital illustrations that blend art and technology. Educators also play a crucial role in the Processing community, with teachers and professors using the language as a teaching tool to introduce students to programming concepts. Students across various educational levels, from high school to university, engage with Processing as an entry point into programming, digital art, and data visualization. Furthermore, researchers working in fields such as data visualization, human-computer interaction, and computational art rely on Processing for prototyping and exploring new concepts. For instance, the research project 'Seeing Data' by Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi utilized Processing to visualize complex data sets in an artistic and engaging manner.

Useful Resources for Processing

Several valuable resources exist for individuals interested in learning and utilizing Processing. The official Processing website, processing.org, is the primary source for downloading the Processing IDE, accessing reference materials, tutorials, and examples.

## Reflection:

Through engaging discussions and shared experiences in DGL 104, I've been fascinated to learn how programming languages like Processing open creative avenues for artists and educators, blending code with visual arts. This interdisciplinary approach has broadened my perspective, showing me how code can transcend traditional boundaries.

For example, the work of artist and programmer Zach Lieberman showcases the innovative use of Processing to create interactive installations and digital art. His projects often involve the use of motion tracking and computer vision, demonstrating the potential of programming languages to bring art to life in dynamic and engaging ways. This fusion of technology and art has led to the development of new media art, where artists use code as a medium for creative expression.

Processing, with its focus on visual arts and interactive design, has provided a gateway for artists to explore the world of programming. Its simplicity and immediate visual feedback make it an ideal platform for beginners to experiment with code and create visually compelling projects. This aligns with the theory of constructionism, which emphasizes learning through making and creating artifacts. By engaging with Processing, artists and educators can embody this theory, fostering a deeper understanding of programming principles through hands-on experiences.

Python, as my next exploration, offers a versatile and accessible platform for beginners, making it an ideal choice for those looking to expand their programming skills. The language's readability and extensive libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, have made it a popular choice for data science and machine learning applications. An example of Python's impact can be seen in the field of scientific research, where it has become a staple tool for data analysis and visualization.

# Activity 4 - CONTRIBUTE TO PATTERN-LIBRARY
From the pattern library issues, I selected Final README.md editing pass for formatting consistency #21 issue and I got assigned to the issue with one more student. Documentation is also a important part of git projects. That's why I choose this.

## FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
What is the hardest/most challenging thing you had to do this week for DGL 104? How did you overcome this challenge?
I found most challenging part is to find the right pattern library. So i discussed with other students and I found one repo where I can help the other student to complete the issues.

                                                           # Week 11

# Activity 1 - READ THROUGH PATTERN LIBRARY ISSUES
I browsed through the issues and PRs of the pattern library. I spent some time browsing similar pattern library repos to identify things that can be added. I assign to review README.md files.

# Activity 3 - CONTRIBUTE TO PATTERN-LIBRARY
For the pattern library, I assigned by another student to work on README.md file. I have to review the following files 
* Creational/Dart/README
* Creational/Javascript/README
* Creational/ReactNative/README
* MVC/README
* observers/README
So I go throughly and update the files with making changes in it.

                                                           # Week 12
# Contribution to Pattern Library

As I was assigned to work along other student on Final README.md editing pass for formatting consistency #21 issue. I have to go through the check liat and have to make changes in the README.md files in the filies mentioned below:
* Creational/Dart/README
* Creational/Javascript/README
* Creational/ReactNative/README
* MVC/README
* observers/README
During fixing the issues I found that few README.md files were empty. So rest of the files I updated with the corrections.
